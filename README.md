# MTL-XF-037 — Commercial Building Energy Demand Efficiency Optimisation Intelligence

**Track:** Cross-Functional · **Use case:** Commercial / private sector · **Team:** 6–8 · **Duration:** 8 weeks

This is a simulated confidential-client engagement using public/open data. Stakeholders and commercial/security scenarios are fictional. Do not claim real-client employment, endorsement, operational deployment or realised benefits. This master pack specifies work to be completed; it does not claim the team has executed it.

## Business commission

**Client:** Confidential Facilities and Energy Services Provider. **Decision owner:** Commercial Energy Services Director. **Cadence:** monthly energy-service pilot review.

A commercial energy-services provider needs to demonstrate a reliable demand-analysis method before seeking a customer-site pilot. The available data come from a single low-energy house, so commercial savings, occupancy effects and contractual comfort compliance require further evidence.

**Decision:** Select three monitored scheduling hypotheses and a commercial-site validation plan.

## End-to-end delivery

Deliver business requirements, governed source acquisition, engineering and data quality, seven defined metrics, baseline/alternative policy comparison, decision dashboard, assurance/UAT, executive recommendation and operational handover. A model alone is insufficient.

Rank hour-of-week windows by observed appliance kWh and compare with a lagged-demand forecast. Model 5%, 10%, 15% reductions within nominated windows at assumed £0.20/£0.30/£0.40 per kWh, never as verified savings. Keep temperature/humidity diagnostic plots; propose comfort monitoring rather than fabricated compliance.

## Core dataset and frozen cohort

**S1:** [Appliances Energy Prediction](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/374). **Input:** energydata_complete.csv. **Source population:** 19,735 ten-minute observations.

All 19,735 original timestamps in energydata_complete.csv, approximately 4.5 months. Preserve source-local timestamps without inventing a timezone. Confirm actual minimum/maximum dates and sampling gaps at acquisition.

This is a residential proxy, not a commercial-building portfolio. Appliances and lights are Wh per interval; no measured occupancy, tariff, floor area or commercial comfort standard exists. Exclude random rv1/rv2. Same-interval sensor explanations are not advance forecasts.

No raw data are uploaded by this update. Teams preserve original bytes outside Git in an approved durable snapshot, with checksums, source metadata and reviewer access. The source register records verification evidence and acquisition rules.

## Evaluation and policy boundary

Chronological first 60% train, next 20% validation, last 20% test by timestamp. Core forecast is next-interval Appliances using only information available through the preceding interval; lag all contemporaneous sensors/weather as needed. Drop boundary/gap targets with row accounting. Compare previous-interval and train-only hour-of-week median baselines.

**Primary risk:** Multiplying interval Wh by duration again or extrapolating one house into proven commercial savings would invalidate the decision case.

At G1 (week 2), approve requirements, source rights, actual schema and frozen bytes. At G2 (week 4), approve row accounting, all seven metrics and evaluation design. At G3 (week 6), review baseline/alternative and uncertainty. At G4 (week 8), require all twelve deliverables, ten executed domain tests, three UAT tasks, five reconciliations and a distinct-member clean rerun.

Assign named authors and review partners. Unsupported mandatory outputs remain blocked until an approved source/scope change resolves them. Record actual results in a separate Mettelo team repository; this master defines the work.
